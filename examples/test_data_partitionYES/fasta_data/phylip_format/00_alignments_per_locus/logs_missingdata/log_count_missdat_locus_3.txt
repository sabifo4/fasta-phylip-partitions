Eq: num_gaps / ( num_taxa * len_aln ) --> (0+0)/((0+5)*85)
Avg missing data before removing missing taxa = 0 = 0%
Eq: num_gaps / ( num_taxa * len_aln ) --> 0/(5*85)
Avg missing data after removing missing taxa = 0 = 0%


Eq: num_gaps / ( num_taxa * len_aln ) --> (0+7)/((0+5)*85)
Avg missing data before removing missing taxa = 0 = 0%
Eq: num_gaps / ( num_taxa * len_aln ) --> 7/(5*85)
Avg missing data after removing missing taxa = 0 = 0%
